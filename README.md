## 🧠 Abstract
<details>
<summary><strong>TL;DR We introduce Anywhere3D-Bench, a holistic 3D visual grounding benchmark consisting of 2.6K referring expression-3D bounding box pairs spanning four different grounding levels: human-activity areas, unoccupied space beyond objects, objects in the scene, and fine-grained object parts.</strong></summary>

3D visual grounding has made notable progress in localizing objects within complex 3D scenes. However, grounding referring expressions beyond objects in 3D scenes remains unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Anywhere3D-Bench, a holistic 3D visual grounding benchmark consisting of 2,632 referring expression-3D bounding box pairs spanning four different grounding levels: human-activity areas, unoccupied space beyond objects, objects in the scene, and fine-grained object parts. We assess a range of state-of-the-art 3D visual grounding methods alongside large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) on Anywhere3D-Bench. Experimental results reveal that space-level and part-level visual grounding pose the greatest challenges: space-level tasks require a more comprehensive spatial reasoning ability, for example, modeling distances and spatial relations within 3D space, while part-level tasks demand fine-grained perception of object composition. Even the best performance model, OpenAI o4-mini, achieves only 23.57% accuracy on space-level tasks and 33.94% on part-level tasks, significantly lower than its performance on area-level and object-level tasks. These findings underscore a critical gap in current models' capacity to understand and reason about 3D scene beyond object-level semantics.

## 🛠️ Implementation

To reproduce the evaluation results on Anywhere3D-Bench

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anywhere-3d/Anywhere3D.git
cd Anywhere3D
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Generate LLM's prediction on Anywhere3D(Please add your own API-KEY for corresponding models: GPT-4.1, o4-mini, Qwen, DeepSeek...)
```bash
cd LLM
python generate_predictions.py
```

Evaluate LLM's prediction on Anywhere3D(Please extract the center coordinates and sizes of the predicted bounding box first, then evaluate)
```bash
cd LLM
python process_bbx_with_regular_expression.py
python process_bbx_with_LLM.py
python evaluate_predictions.py
```

Generate VLM's prediction on Anywhere3D(Please follow GPT4Scene to generate Bird's Eye View and Video Frames of each scene first and save them in corresponding folder, i.e. ./3RScan_gpt4scene_data, ./arkitscene_gpt4scene_data, ./multiscan_gpt4scene_data, ./scannet_gpt4scene_data.  Add your own API-KEY for corresponding models: GPT-4.1, o4-mini, Qwen, InternVL3.)
```bash
cd VLM
python generate_predictions.py
```

Evaluate VLM's prediction on Anywhere3D(Please extract the center coordinates and sizes of the predicted bounding box first, then evaluate)
```bash
cd VLM
python process_bbx_with_regular_expression.py
python process_bbx_with_LLM.py
python evaluate_predictions.py
```
